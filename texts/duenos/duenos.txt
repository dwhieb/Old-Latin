  - text: The Duenos inscription is one of the earliest Old Latin texts, dating from the 7th to 5th century BC. It is inscribed on the sides of a _kernos_, a set of three vases attached by struts. It was found by Heinrich Dressel in 1880 on the Quirinal Hill in Rome. See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duenos_inscription) about the Duenos inscription for more information.
